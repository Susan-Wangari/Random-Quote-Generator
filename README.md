# Random-Quote-Generator
Welcome to the Random Quote Generator!

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates a random quote from a collection of pre-selected quotes. The quote can be displayed on the page or written to the console.

To run the program, make sure you have a web browser with JavaScript enabled. Then, open the index.html file in your web browser. The generated quote will be displayed on the page.

You can also view the generated quote in the console by opening the browser's developer tools and navigating to the console tab.

I hope you enjoy using the Random Quote Generator!
